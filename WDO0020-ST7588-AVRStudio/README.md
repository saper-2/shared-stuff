# Driver for WDO0020 LCD 
This display I think is custom made for cash register (printer?).

### The story...
Manufacturer offered me to buy new one (because it's custom made so no datasheet for bystanders).. So I was poking around their products on www, that was not really successful anyway, but I was sure that they had to use controller they knew... 

My basic problem was: if If I could at least know the controller IC then other stuff I can figure out easily...

And I got stuck by crazy idea, I looked through their website and collected list (and datasheets) for IC COG controllers that they use, and checked if those might have different sizes that are unique for each specific chip. And that was **bingo!!!!**. I measured with digital caliper gently size of chip on display glass and compared with sizes on collected datasheets. And I found that ST7588 match perfectly (almost, just few hundreds of mm different but there is that rubber epox glue on it too)...
As for pinout it was now easy-peasy, the chip have pinout in order like on FPC, so just match those obvious lines like Vcc and GND, and other pins will "fit" automatically...
